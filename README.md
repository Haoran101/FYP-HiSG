# Augmented Reality Flutter Sample App by Wikitude

by Wikitude GmbH - [www.wikitude.com](https://www.wikitude.com)

Sample projects for Android and iOS demoing the most common use-cases.

# Documentation & Samples  

* To make this project work, the first step is to import all the packages on it by using the following command where the `.yaml` file is located:

	```
	$ flutter pub get
	```

    It could be possible that the `augmented\_reality\_plugin_wikitude` plugin also requires to call the same command inside its folder `plugin/augmented\_reality\_plugin_wikitude`.

### iOS development

* Open the `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` project with Xcode. Select the `Runner` target, open the `Signing & Capabilities` tab and input your signing settings.

* Navigate into the root project of the example app in your terminal, and input the following command:

    ```
    $ flutter run
    ```

    This will generate and configure the `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` and run the app on your device.

### Known issues

* It is a known issue that when trying to generate a release Android apk in Flutter, the following error can happen:

    ```
    AndroidRuntime: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: dalvik.system.PathClassLoader[DexPathList[[zip file "/data/app/com.wikitude.fluttersamples/base.apk"],nativeLibraryDirectories=[/data/app/com.wikitude.fluttersamples/lib/arm, /data/app/com.wikitude.fluttersamples/base.apk!/lib/armeabi-v7a, /vendor/lib, /system/lib]]] couldn't find "libflutter.so"
    ```

    Because of that, if you build the application in release mode, you will have to put the following code inside `wikitude\_flutter_app/android/app/build.gradle` at the end of the `defaultConfig` section:

    ```
    ndk {
        abiFilters 'armeabi-v7a'
    }
    ```

* Windows can't handle long paths. In case you open the project in Windows and you get the following error:

    ```
    FileSystemException: FileSystemException: Cannot open file, path = 'C:\Users\username\Desktop\Wikitude_Flutter_ExampleApp_8-10-0_2019-10-24_04-00-43\build\app\intermediates\flutter\debug\android-arm64/flutter_assets\samples/04_CloudRecognition_3_UsingMetainformationInTheResponse/jquery/jquery-mobile-transparent-ui-overlay.css'
    ```

    You will have to unzip the project trying to keep the name of the folder as short as possible to avoid this problem.
